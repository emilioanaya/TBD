  <p>The TBD Dynasty League isn't just any fantasy football league — it’s the greatest Portuguese fantasy football league on the planet. Founded in 2023, TBD brings together ten fierce competitors battling year-round in a Superflex, PPR, Tight End Premium format that rewards bold trades, deep scouting, and dynasty-level strategy.</p>
  <p>In its inaugural season, Los Azules (formerly My Diggs Small), led by an unimaginable wide receiver room of CeeDee Lamb, Justin Jefferson and Davante Adams, stunned the league by storming from a 6-8 regular season finish to win it all in the playoffs. The following year, Norcal Seleçáo rose to power, claiming the 2024 championship behind a loaded roster headlined by Trey McBride, Ja'Marr Chase, and rookie Malik Nabers.</p>
  <p>TBD isn’t just about the trophies — it’s about long-term rivalries, blockbuster trades, and a tight-knit community with Portuguese roots and plenty of trash talk. Every offseason move matters, every draft pick counts, and every matchup adds fuel to the fire.</p>
  <p>Whether you're a founding member or a curious onlooker, welcome to TBD — where legends are built, rebuilt, and sometimes tank for picks.</p>

JD’s always lurking, always cooking something up, and always one Rams meltdown away from rebranding the Armada to “Azorean Rebuild.” With a big personality, a bigger nose, and a quietly stacked roster, JD’s looking to bring some real silverware to the islands — or at least win one more trade than Daniel.",

A fullback enthusiast stuck in a wide receiver era, Lucas somehow spends more time scouting lead blockers than actual fantasy starters. And while most of us use Sleeper to set lineups, Lucas uses it to rewatch Bucky Irving highlights like it’s game tape. Between dodging Daniel’s football advice and explaining why the Vacas “just need one more piece,” Lucas continues to make draft picks based on vibes, Portuguese bias, and whether a guy would do well in futsal. Despite being TBD’s answer to Mike McDaniel without the winning, Lucas is determined to prove this year that Juszczyk tape and alto sax solos are all part of the master plan.",
