  <p>The TBD Dynasty League isn't just any fantasy football league ‚Äî it‚Äôs the greatest Portuguese fantasy football league on the planet. Founded in 2023, TBD brings together ten fierce competitors battling year-round in a Superflex, PPR, Tight End Premium format that rewards bold trades, deep scouting, and dynasty-level strategy.</p>
  <p>In its inaugural season, Los Azules (formerly My Diggs Small), led by an unimaginable wide receiver room of CeeDee Lamb, Justin Jefferson and Davante Adams, stunned the league by storming from a 6-8 regular season finish to win it all in the playoffs. The following year, Norcal Sele√ß√°o rose to power, claiming the 2024 championship behind a loaded roster headlined by Trey McBride, Ja'Marr Chase, and rookie Malik Nabers.</p>
  <p>TBD isn‚Äôt just about the trophies ‚Äî it‚Äôs about long-term rivalries, blockbuster trades, and a tight-knit community with Portuguese roots and plenty of trash talk. Every offseason move matters, every draft pick counts, and every matchup adds fuel to the fire.</p>
  <p>Whether you're a founding member or a curious onlooker, welcome to TBD ‚Äî where legends are built, rebuilt, and sometimes tank for picks.</p>

His knowledge of the Portuguese National Team is elite, but sadly, Jo√£o F√©lix doesn‚Äôt get PPR points. Despite fielding a roster that feels like it was drafted straight off vibes and FIFA ratings, Daniel somehow remains competitive. His new crib in Stanislaus County is still waiting on its first piece of fantasy hardware ‚Äî but hey, at least it has room for all his CR7 posters. With his Av√≥s in the stands and Ronaldo in his heart, Daniel hopes this is finally the year he brings glory to the most Portuguese team in TBD.",
