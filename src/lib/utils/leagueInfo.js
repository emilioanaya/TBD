  <p>The TBD Dynasty League isn't just any fantasy football league — it’s the greatest Portuguese fantasy football league on the planet. Founded in 2023, TBD brings together ten fierce competitors battling year-round in a Superflex, PPR, Tight End Premium format that rewards bold trades, deep scouting, and dynasty-level strategy.</p>
  <p>In its inaugural season, Los Azules (formerly My Diggs Small), led by an unimaginable wide receiver room of CeeDee Lamb, Justin Jefferson and Davante Adams, stunned the league by storming from a 6-8 regular season finish to win it all in the playoffs. The following year, Norcal Seleçáo rose to power, claiming the 2024 championship behind a loaded roster headlined by Trey McBride, Ja'Marr Chase, and rookie Malik Nabers.</p>
  <p>TBD isn’t just about the trophies — it’s about long-term rivalries, blockbuster trades, and a tight-knit community with Portuguese roots and plenty of trash talk. Every offseason move matters, every draft pick counts, and every matchup adds fuel to the fire.</p>
  <p>Whether you're a founding member or a curious onlooker, welcome to TBD — where legends are built, rebuilt, and sometimes tank for picks.</p>
